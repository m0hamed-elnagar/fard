 *make the missed salaah  only for the ones that already pass time  so if i just
  finished the asr why do i see that i missed the isha while it didn't come yet so only add
   them and show them in red when  they pass time and didn't yet be completed by the user
    but don't make them complete too find a good fix that don't add them to complete of missed
    if there time didn't come yet
also  the check is the today btn is effecting the qada wrongly or not
show the line of days we are in while the calender is shrinked
the today  fard and the past qada isn't working right can u search and make a plan  to fix it  i need u to know that the qada is the missed from the other days  and each day i will have more sallahs if i didn't pray it will be the qada of the next day and so on search to get the hol of what u need to do and make a plane with testing and everything and excute the plan
